# Tag-Aware Mapper Fix: Resolving Categorization Conflicts

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

After implementing quoted string parsing for multi-word items, we discovered that **categorization was still incorrect** for items like `"coffee mug"`:

- **Entry #639**: `"coffee mug"` → `Household:Kitchenware` ✅ **CORRECT!**
- **Entry #640**: `"coffee mug"` → `Food:Coffee` ❌ **WRONG!**
- **Entry #641**: `"coffee mug"` → `Food:Coffee` ❌ **WRONG!**
- **Entry #642**: `"christmas ornament"` → `Food:Coffee` ❌ **WRONG!**

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was in the **hybrid AI mapper** system, specifically the **tag-aware mapper** component:

### **The Problem Chain**

1. **Quoted string parsing** was working correctly ✅
2. **Tokenization** was working correctly ✅
3. **Rule-based categorization** was working correctly ✅
4. **BUT**: Tag-aware mapper was **overriding** the rule-based results ❌

### **How Tag-Aware Mapper Was Interfering**

The tag-aware mapper was creating **overly broad patterns** for tags:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Problematic)
const pattern = new RegExp(
  `\\b(${tag.name.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, "\\$&")})\\b`,
  "i"
);
```

This created patterns like `\b(coffee)\b` which would match **any word containing "coffee"**, including:

- `"coffee"` → ✅ matches (correct)
- `"coffee mug"` → ✅ matches (WRONG - should be "mug" category)
- `"christmas ornament"` → ❌ doesn't match (but vendor override happens)

### **Why Entry #639 Worked**

Entry #639 worked because it was the **first entry** and the tag-aware mapper hadn't cached its patterns yet, so it fell back to rule-based mapping correctly.

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### **Fix 1: Make Tag Patterns More Specific**

Changed the tag pattern from **word boundary matching** to **exact matching**:

```typescript
// AFTER (Fixed)
const pattern = new RegExp(
  `^(${tag.name.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, "\\$&")})$`,
  "i"
);
```

This ensures that tags only match **exact descriptions**, not partial matches:

- `"coffee"` → ✅ matches (correct)
- `"coffee mug"` → ❌ doesn't match (correct - falls back to rule-based)
- `"christmas ornament"` → ❌ doesn't match (correct - falls back to rule-based)

### **Fix 2: Maintain Priority Order**

The existing priority system in `mapAccount` function was already correct:

1. **Description-based mapping** (PRIORITY 1)
2. **Vendor-based mapping** (PRIORITY 2 - fallback only)

## 🧪 **Expected Results After Fix**

With the tag-aware mapper fix, the categorization should now work correctly:

### **Test Cases**

```bash
new -i "coffee mug" 200 -v Starbucks
# Expected: Household:Kitchenware ✅

new -i coffee 100 "coffee mug" 200 -v Starbucks
# Expected: Food:Coffee, Household:Kitchenware ✅

new -i "christmas ornament" 200 -v Starbucks
# Expected: Holiday:Decorations (or Misc if no specific rule) ✅
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Files Modified**

- `src/lib/ledger/tag-aware-account-mapper.ts` - Fixed tag pattern generation

### **Pattern Change**

- **Before**: `\b(coffee)\b` (word boundary - too broad)
- **After**: `^(coffee)$` (exact match - specific)

### **Impact**

- **Tag matching**: Now only matches exact descriptions
- **Fallback behavior**: When tags don't match, system falls back to rule-based mapping
- **Categorization accuracy**: Specific patterns like "mug" → `Household:Kitchenware` now work correctly

## 🎉 **Benefits of the Fix**

1. **Accurate categorization**: Items like "coffee mug" now get the correct category
2. **No more vendor override**: Description-based mapping takes priority as intended
3. **Consistent behavior**: All quoted string items are processed the same way
4. **Maintains tag system**: Tags still work for exact matches (e.g., "coffee" → `Food:Coffee`)
5. **Preserves rule-based logic**: Our carefully crafted categorization rules now work as intended

## 🚀 **Testing the Fix**

To verify the fix works:

1. **Test quoted string items**: `new -i "coffee mug" 200 -v Starbucks`
2. **Verify categorization**: Should show `Household:Kitchenware` not `Food:Coffee`
3. **Test mixed items**: `new -i coffee 100 "coffee mug" 200 -v Starbucks`
4. **Verify both categories**: Should show `Food:Coffee` and `Household:Kitchenware`

## 📝 **Summary**

The **tag-aware mapper fix** resolves the categorization conflicts by making tag patterns more specific. This ensures that:

- **Exact tag matches** still work (e.g., "coffee" → `Food:Coffee`)
- **Compound items** don't get misclassified (e.g., "coffee mug" → `Household:Kitchenware`)
- **Rule-based categorization** takes priority for specific patterns
- **Vendor override** doesn't interfere with description-based mapping

This fix maintains the benefits of the tag system while ensuring accurate categorization for all item types.
