Subject: Application for Producer Position in Asia

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am interested to apply for the producer position as a video producer. I have been based in Bangkok for over a decade and I have developed many industry connections and a strong understanding of production in Asia. My experience as a line producer and video maker spans global brands such as Facebook, Canon, and Dell, as well as various local companies. Throughout my career, I have managed both production and post-production, ensuring seamless execution across various types of video projects.

Beyond my production experience, I am the founder of Bangkok Filmmakers, a thriving online community of over 10,000 members. I actively engage with some of the most talented and active creators in the region holding regular networking events. I also founded the 60 Second Film Festival, a popular short film showcase that has been celebrating local and international talent since 2017. Our events have drawn hundreds of people per event and foster community and accomplishment. Our latest event was in September of 2024. 

Additionally, I develop websites and software tools to support my video production projects. One of my current projects is building an online database of creators, talent and vendors related to the local film and video industry. 

These initiatives have given me an extensive network and a keen eye for local storytelling that resonates on a global scale. 

I am eager to bring my expertise, network, and passion for storytelling to a producer position. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your needs. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience.

Best regards,

Oliver Wolfson
