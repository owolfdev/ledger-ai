Next.js 15 introduces major improvements that enhance the developer experience. Key APIs like params, cookies(), and headers() are now asynchronous, creating a more consistent async model. Caching behavior has changed: fetch requests, route handlers, and client navigations are no longer cached by default, improving dynamic content delivery. Turbopack is stable for development, offering faster server startup and hot reloading. The @next/codemod CLI simplifies upgrades, while enhanced error overlays and static/dynamic route indicators improve debugging and optimization. Additional updates include TypeScript support in next.config.ts, better bundling for external libraries, and ESLint 9 compatibility.
