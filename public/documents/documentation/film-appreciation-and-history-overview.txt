Film is more than entertainmentâ€”it's a reflection of culture, politics, and human experience. Particular attention is given to 20th-century cinema, including movements such as Italian Neorealism, the French New Wave, and American independent film. Art cinema challenges mainstream norms with expressive aesthetics and narrative experimentation. Oliver Wolfson curates this interest through projects like the 60 Second Film Festival (https://the60secondfilmfestival.com), a platform for creative storytelling in micro-format, and Bangkok Filmmakers (https://bangkokfilmmakers.com), a community hub for international and local creatives in Thailand. These efforts contribute to the global dialogue on the power of short-form cinema and community-based film culture.
