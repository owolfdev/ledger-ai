    "description": "Overview of major changes in Next.js 15 including async route parameters and improved streaming.",
    "content": "Next.js 15 introduces major improvements that enhance the developer experience. Key APIs like params, cookies(), and headers() are now asynchronous, creating a more consistent async model. Caching behavior has changed: fetch requests, route handlers, and client navigations are no longer cached by default, improving dynamic content delivery. Turbopack is stable for development, offering faster server startup and hot reloading. The @next/codemod CLI simplifies upgrades, while enhanced error overlays and static/dynamic route indicators improve debugging and optimization. Additional updates include TypeScript support in next.config.ts, better bundling for external libraries, and ESLint 9 compatibility."

    "description": "Exploration of film as an artistic, cultural, and historical medium with a focus on 20th-century cinema, French New Wave, and independent film movements.",
    "content": "Film is more than entertainmentâ€”it's a reflection of culture, politics, and human experience. Particular attention is given to 20th-century cinema, including movements such as Italian Neorealism, the French New Wave, and American independent film. Art cinema challenges mainstream norms with expressive aesthetics and narrative experimentation. Oliver Wolfson curates this interest through projects like the 60 Second Film Festival (https://the60secondfilmfestival.com), a platform for creative storytelling in micro-format, and Bangkok Filmmakers (https://bangkokfilmmakers.com), a community hub for international and local creatives in Thailand. These efforts contribute to the global dialogue on the power of short-form cinema and community-based film culture. My favorite films are: The Seven Samurai, Spirited Away, The Shining, Sonatine, Chung King Express, Goodfellas, The Godfather, Alien, Blade Runner, Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, The films of Akira Kurosawa, Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, Robert Altman, Ridley Scott, Quentin Tarantino, Takeshi Kitano and Wong Kar Wai."
