# Privacy & Data

This **privacy-aware space** respects your data and your time. No trackers. No ads. No unnecessary scripts.

We collect only the minimal, **anonymous usage data** required to ensure the terminal experience works smoothly â€” like which commands are used most often (e.g. `help`, `projects`, `blog`), purely to improve this site.

We **do not collect** personal data, and we do **not share** any information with third parties.

You're in control. Always.
