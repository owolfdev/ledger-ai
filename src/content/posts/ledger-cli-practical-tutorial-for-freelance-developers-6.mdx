**Ledger CLI** is a double-entry accounting system using plain text files, commonly processed directly in the terminal. Here’s how to use your ledger file for common financial tasks.

This tutorial requires some data to process in a .ledger file. You can user the [sample file](https://www.owolf.com/documents/ledger/my.ledger).

---

## **1. Check Your Account Balances**

### **See balances for all accounts:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance
```

> _Shows how much you have/spent/owe in each account (summary view)._

---

### **See just your bank account balance:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance Assets:Bank:Checking
```

> _How much money is in your checking account._

---

### **See your total cash on hand:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance Assets:Cash
```

> _Your physical cash balance._

---

## **2. Track Your Spending**

### **Total spent on software:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance Expenses:Software
```

> _Sum of all software/tool/service expenses._

---

### **Total spent on hardware:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance Expenses:Hardware
```

---

### **Total spent on coffee:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance Expenses:Food:Coffee
```

---

## **3. Income Overview**

### **Total freelance income received:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance Income:Freelance
```

> _How much you’ve earned from freelance work (will be negative, since income is a credit)._

---

### **Total income from all sources:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance ^Income
```

> _The caret (^) matches all accounts starting with 'Income'._

---

## **4. View Transaction History**

### **Show a register (checkbook) for your bank account:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger register Assets:Bank:Checking
```

> _Shows every deposit/withdrawal, date, payee, and running balance._

---

### **Show a register for a specific expense (e.g., coffee):**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger register Expenses:Food:Coffee
```

---

### **Show all transactions involving a specific keyword:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger register Starbucks
```

> _Any posting with “Starbucks” in the description._

---

## **5. Budgeting and Reports by Category**

### **Sum by top-level category (e.g., all Expenses):**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance ^Expenses
```

> _Total expenses, broken down by sub-account._

---

### **Monthly spending report:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger register ^Expenses --monthly
```

> _Expenses, grouped by month._

---

## **6. Advanced Filtering**

### **Spending in a specific period:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger register ^Expenses --period "2025/02"
```

> _All expenses in February 2025._

---

### **Income for a specific client:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger register Client\ A
```

> _Transactions with “Client A” in the description._

---

### **Filter by tag in description (e.g., #education):**

If you use tags in descriptions (like `#education`):

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger register '#education'
```

---

## **7. Tax and Business Deductions**

### **Sum of deductible expenses (e.g., hardware, software, education):**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance Expenses:Hardware Expenses:Software Expenses:Professional:Education
```

> _Add more accounts as needed for tax time!_

---

### **Total paid in taxes:**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance ^Taxes
```

---

## **8. Miscellaneous**

### **Show all transactions (chronologically):**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger register
```

---

### **Show only top-level account balances (condensed):**

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance --depth 2
```

> _Only two levels deep, for a summarized view._

---

## **9. Export and Save Reports**

You can redirect output to a file:

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance > balances.txt
ledger -f my.ledger register Expenses:Software > software_spending.txt
```

---

## **10. Help and Reference**

```bash
ledger --help
ledger help balance
ledger help register
```

---
