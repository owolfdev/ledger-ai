*Level up your plain-text accounting.*

## 🗂️ Step 7: Organize With Accounts & Hierarchies

Ledger accounts are hierarchical. Use colons to create subaccounts for detailed tracking.

**Example:**

```
2025/08/01 Online course
    Expenses:Education:Courses     $30.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking         -$30.00
```

*Tip:* `ledger balance Expenses` rolls up all subaccounts under Expenses.

---

## 📅 Step 8: Add Dates, Payees & Notes

You can include payees and more details:

```
2025/08/02 Amazon
    Expenses:Office:Supplies   $45.00  ; new mouse
    Assets:Bank:Checking      -$45.00
```

* The first word after the date is the payee/description.
* Add `;` for notes.

---

## 🔄 Step 9: Split Transactions

Split expenses across categories or accounts:

```
2025/08/03 Lunch meeting
    Expenses:Food:Lunch         $12.00
    Expenses:Business:Meals     $18.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking       -$30.00
```

* Both food and business meal expenses are tracked.

## 💱 Step 10: Handling Multiple Currencies

Ledger supports multiple currencies. Specify with the symbol:

```
2025/08/04 PayPal transfer
    Assets:PayPal      €100.00
    Income:Freelance  -€100.00
```

Or mix currencies in a split:

```
2025/08/05 Stock purchase
    Assets:Investments:Stocks     $1000.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking         -$500.00
    Assets:Foreign:THB         -฿18,000.00
```

*Ledger will track balances by currency.*

## 📄 Step 11: Monthly Reports & Filtering

See expenses by month:

```
ledger -f my.ledger register Expenses --period 'last month'
```

Show a single account by month:

```
ledger -f my.ledger register Expenses:Groceries --monthly
```

List all income this year:

```
ledger -f my.ledger register Income --period 'this year'
```

---

## 🔍 Step 12: Search & Tag Transactions

Add custom tags to transactions for easy searching:

```
2025/08/06 Taxi ; :client:projectX:
    Expenses:Travel:Taxi    $8.50
    Assets:Cash           -$8.50
```

Filter by tag:

```
ledger -f my.ledger register ^Expenses --grep projectX
```

---

## 📊 Step 13: Budgeting & Forecasting

Add periodic budgets to your file:

```
~ Monthly
    Expenses:Groceries    $400.00
    Expenses:Dining Out   $100.00
```

Check your spending against your budget:

```
ledger -f my.ledger budget
```

---

## 🔒 Step 14: Best Practices

* **Back up your .ledger file regularly.**
* **Use version control** (like Git) for a history of edits.
* **Consistent naming** for accounts keeps reports tidy.
* **Validate your file:**

  ```
  ledger -f my.ledger check
  ```
