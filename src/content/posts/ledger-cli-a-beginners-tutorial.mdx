# 🧾 Ledger CLI: A Beginner’s Tutorial

> Track your money using plain text files and the command line!

---

## 📦 Step 1: Install Ledger CLI

### Mac (with Homebrew):

```bash
brew install ledger
```

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt install ledger
```

### Windows:

- Use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or download from [https://ledger-cli.org](https://ledger-cli.org)

---

## 📁 Step 2: Create a `.ledger` File

Create a plain text file called `my.ledger`:

```bash
touch my.ledger
```

Then open it in your favorite editor (VS Code, Vim, etc).

---

## ✍️ Step 3: Add Your First Transaction

Paste this into `my.ledger`:

```ledger
2025/07/22 Bought groceries
    Expenses:Groceries         $50.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking      -$50.00
```

This means:

- You spent \$50 on groceries
- The money came from your bank account

---

## 📊 Step 4: See Your Account Balances

In the terminal, run:

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance
```

Output:

```
           $50.00  Expenses:Groceries
          -$50.00  Assets:Bank:Checking
--------------------
                   0
```

---

## ➕ Step 5: Add More Transactions

Append more entries like:

```ledger
2025/07/23 Freelance income
    Assets:Bank:Checking      $500.00
    Income:Freelance         -$500.00

2025/07/24 Rent payment
    Expenses:Housing:Rent     $700.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking     -$700.00
```

Then run:

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger register
```

To see a **checkbook-style ledger**.

---

## 🔎 Step 6: Filter by Account

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger register Expenses
```

Or:

```bash
ledger -f my.ledger balance Income
```

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tips

- Transactions must **balance to zero**
- Indent all account lines with **spaces**, not tabs
- Use `;` for comments

Example with a comment:

```ledger
2025/07/25 Coffee at cafe
    Expenses:Food:Coffee      $3.50   ; morning espresso
    Assets:Cash              -$3.50
```

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- Try splitting an expense (e.g. part business, part personal)
- Create your own categories like `Expenses:Business:Marketing`
- Add `Income:Property:Rent`, `Expenses:Health:Insurance`, etc.
